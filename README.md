#BlockEdfWrite

Rewrite or create new European Data Format (EDF). BlockEdfWrite builds on the structure developed in [BlockEdfLoad](https://github.com/DennisDean/BlockEdfLoad) and extended in [BlockEdfLoadClass](https://github.com/DennisDean/BlockEdfLoadClass).  A [signal generator](https://github.com/DennisDean/SignalGeneratorClass) is used to demonstrate how to create new EDFs. BlockEdfWrite has also been used to de-identify a file.

**It is reccomended that you make a copy of your EDFs when using this function.**
